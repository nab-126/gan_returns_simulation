Financial time series are complex by nature; the scarcity of historical financial data is a major hindrance in the development of trading algorithms. Most of those models are prone to overfitting as they have been trained on limited data; that of the realized history. Yet, there are possibly multiple states of the world all of which cannot be represented in a single time series. In this project, we train a Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network to produce synthetic but realistic time series data. 

## Project Structure
The W-GAN was built in Python using the Pytorch framework.
